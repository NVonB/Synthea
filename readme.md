# Synthea

Synthea is my attempt at dynamically simulating the phenomenon of chromesthesia (sound-to-color synesthesia). Synthea is not just a music visualizer and will use information taken from chromesthesiatic persons with the aim of creating deterministic visuals that match their experiences as close as possible 

# To Do

Implement functions to interpert sound files to data including:
    pitch, tone, key, chords, relative volume, eventually melody progression

Implement functions to convert data into meaningful visual phenomenon (static first, dynamic eventually)
